# Logestic-regression-with-Batch-and-online-training-ROC-curve
Created training set of 2000 2D multi-variate normal random numbers and labeled them 
created test data set of 1000 2D multi-variate normal random number and labeled them 
This program COmpares Batch training logestic regression and Online training logestic regression
Given different learning rates like n={1,0.1,0.01} I tried to calculate the weights, Accuracy on training data and test data
I ploted each result using ROC curve. 
I have also figured out the number of iteration that was needed to minimize the error. 
 
 What is an ROC curve?
A receiver operating characteristic curve, i.e., ROC curve, is a graphical plot that is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
